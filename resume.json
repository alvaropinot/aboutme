Eager to learn and ready to share.\n\nI strongly believe that if you are not part of the solution, you are probably part of the problem. \n\nSpeaking of problems, I always enjoy a good challenge. I think the way to go is to use technology to solve challenges without losing sight of human-personal interactions and avoid technology to get on the way. Remember the ‚Äúif you are not part of...‚Äù well you get the point üòÖ\n\nI do ‚ù§Ô∏è using smilies, music ü§ò and motorbikes.\n\nYou can find some of the companies where I‚Äôve been doing this‚òùÔ∏èduring the last decade+ hereüëá\n\nWant to have some fun together, a chat or a coffee?
